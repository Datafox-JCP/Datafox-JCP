### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Juan Carlos Pazos** from Mexico. I have been programming since I was 17 (actually I have 43 years in this).

I love tech and software developement. The past 28 years I was an independent developer recognized as Datafox. Must of that time creating Windows applications with MS Access and Visual Basic. Now I enjoy work as iOS developer using SwiftUI.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on several things:
  - Creating a grief app.
  - Next iOS app.... secret project ðŸ˜‰
  - Creating my fist paid course
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot of things
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on iOS proyects
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about SwiftUI but sure Chat GPT can give you better answers, but personal opinions about development and tech in general, after 43 years I learned somethings.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Twitter and Facebook, maybe you want to follow me there, because you will find regular posts about Swift, SwiftUI and Xcode.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: I still did not understand why this is so common (maybe because I'm old) but He/Him are the pronouns
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have 3 cats (Lucrecia, Booker, Fionna). It's fun because cats are fun.
